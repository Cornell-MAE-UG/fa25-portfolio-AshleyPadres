<h1>737 Boeing Max Incident Ethical Analysis</h1>

<p>
In 2018 and 2019, two Boeing 737 MAX aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff due to a common design failure. 
Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea near Indonesia on October 29, 2018, killing all 189 people on board, 
and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, on March 10, 2019, killing all 157 passengers and crew. 
The primary cause in both accidents was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an automated flight-control 
feature that repeatedly forced the aircraft nose downward based on faulty data from a single angle-of-attack sensor. 
Pilots were not adequately informed or trained on MCAS, and the system lacked sufficient redundancy and safeguards. 
Together, the crashes claimed 346 lives and led to the global grounding of the 737 MAX, raising serious ethical questions about 
engineering design decisions, safety trade-offs, regulatory oversight, and corporate responsibility.
</p>

<p><b>
From an ethical standpoint, through the MAE 4300 - Engineers and Society class, I identified some of the major ethical questions regarding the incident:
</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Who gets a say in the creation of the testing requirements and procedures for the test pilots? And who oversees the work of the test pilots?</li>
  <li>How much timeline pressure from management should be allowed to trickle downward directly to engineers?</li>
  <li>Should internal employees of Boeing be allowed to regulate for the external organization of the FAA?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>
For each of these ethical concerns, we find the following facts regarding this incident that give more insight on the complexity of these scenarios, and by looking at these through the lens of the ASME Ethical Canons 
<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, the ethical grievances come to light:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Who gets a say in the creation of the testing procedures for the pilots? Within Boeing, in the development of these, is it the engineers, or management, or the test pilots who get to decide how much testing is “enough”? Further, who oversees the work or conclusions of the test pilots?</b>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
            A key contributor to this incident was “the constraint (contractually agreed to with Southwest Airlines) of minimizing the training requirements for carriers that ordered the MAX. By committing to producing an aircraft that would not trigger simulation-based training, engineers were restricted in design choices that would have improved safety. Boeing employees that interfaced with the FAA were compelled to lobby against the inclusion of information about technological changes in training manuals that would have enhanced pilot understanding of the MAX’s functionality, for fear that the addition of language would have required more extensive training.”
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “In and around November 2016, two of Boeing’s 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots, one who was then the 737 MAX Chief Technical Pilot and another who would later become the 737 MAX Chief Technical Pilot, discovered information about an important change to MCAS. Rather than sharing information about this change with the FAA... [they] concealed this information and deceived the FAA AEG about MCAS. Because of this deceit, the FAA AEG deleted all information about MCAS from the final version of the 737 MAX FSB Report... In turn, airplane manuals and pilot training materials for U.S.-based airlines lacked information about MCAS, and pilots flying the 737 MAX for Boeing’s airline customers were not provided any information about MCAS in their manuals and training materials.” 
            <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “The Boeing board of directors, too, lacked basic mechanisms to oversee aircraft safety. Boeing’s board did not have a standing committee responsible for safety, and safety was not a regular discussion item on the agenda.”
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>
        In this example, canon 1 and 2 present a clear and compelling message that first and foremost, human safety should be prioritized, and 
        aligned with this goal, those with expertise in this area of work– designing thorough testing procedures and protocol for ‘success’ in 
        testing. However, since canons 1 and 4 were at conflict, the engineers and test pilots felt pressured to work with Boeing’s interests and 
        present this aircraft as not needing additional testing.
        </i></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>How much timeline pressure from management should be allowed to trickle downward directly to engineers? Should team leaders shield their engineers or push back against this timeline pressure?</b>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
            “From the beginning, Boeing operated under several constraints. One was a compressed timeline. Airbus announced over 1200 orders for the A320neo in 2011, the year following its introduction. (See Exhibit 2 for order and delivery statistics for the A320neo and 737 MAX). Boeing had to move aggressively to bring the 737 MAX to concept and market in order to remain competitive.”
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “Despite the fact that Boeing was the acquiring company, the merger with McDonnell Douglas brought organizational and cultural change. The companies had different organizational heritages, with McDonnell Douglas emphasizing financial performance and Boeing prioritizing engineering quality. With Stonecipher assuming key leadership roles and a former McDonnell Douglas executive appointed CFO, Boeing’s internal focus shifted. While engineering quality continued to be valued, that objective was run through a stricter filter of financial discipline.”
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “Boeing also subordinated engineering quality through its reporting structure. The engineers responsible for designing the MAX reported to their business unit heads and not to the chief project engineer responsible for signing off on and approving key decisions on the project. (According to the chief project engineer, 'you could say that none of them worked for me but all of them worked for me.') One result of this structure is that, under sworn testimony, the chief engineer claimed to be unaware of key features of MCAS, including its reliance on a single AOA sensor and that it could activate repeatedly.” 
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>
        Prioritizing public safety, as discussed in canon 1, conflicts with canon 4, which directs engineers to act in the faithful interests of 
        their employers. When their employers prioritize profit and a rapid timeline, this can push the engineers to develop an aircraft that might 
        be "technically acceptable” as per FAA standards, but not an aircraft that truly prioritizes human safety.
        </i></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Should internal employees of Boeing be allowed to regulate for the external organization of the FAA?</b>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>
            “One was the initial decision to pursue certification of the MAX as a modification rather than a new model. This decision—made by senior executives for competitive reasons—compelled engineers and managers to consider each technological choice through the lens of its impact on the certification process rather than its technological merit. In the words of one Boeing engineer: “There was a lot of interest and pressure on the certification and analysis engineers in particular to look at any changes to the MAX as minor changes.”
            <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “The department ultimately determined that an independent compliance monitor was unnecessary based on the following factors, among others: (i) the misconduct was neither pervasive across the organization, nor undertaken by a large number of employees, nor facilitated by senior management.”
            <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
            </li>

            <li>
            “Although two of Boeing’s 737 MAX Flight Technical Pilots deceived the FAA AEG about MCAS by way of misleading statements, half-truths, and omissions, others in Boeing disclosed MCAS’s expanded operational scope to different FAA personnel who were responsible for determining whether the 737 MAX met U.S. federal airworthiness standards.”
            <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>
        These quotes make it evident that holistically, there was conflict between Boeing’s management, engineers, and test pilots, regarding the 
        goals and decisions made for this aircraft. While the third quote makes it evident that at least a good portion of the Boeing engineers 
        interfaced with the FAA with no mal intent, fully presenting information regarding MCAS, this situation makes evident the ethical conflicts 
        occurring for any internal employees designated to regulate for the FAA. Generally, for internal regulators, we can see them experiencing 
        conflicts between canons 1, 2, 4 and 7, where pressure from those around them can challenge them to debate prioritizing human safety or 
        acting in the best interest of their employees, while potentially being put into positions where they’re either (a) working outside of their 
        expertise or (b) concealing information.
        </i></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><b>
Each of these scenarios demonstrate the danger of loose ethical standards within the engineering industry as a whole. As engineers, we must uphold the standards of the 11 canons outlined in the ASME code of ethics 
<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, 
since, as demonstrated through these examples, the potential risk associated with these dilemmas could have been reduced had all involved– the test pilots, engineers, and management– been aligned on their ethical priorities.
